The bot has to be added in 2 different groups. One of them is for the admins to do the operations using the bot and the other is for the bot to do public announcements etc.
Enter the Admins group ID and the public Group ID in the bot.py (See the Telegram API on how to do this)
See the below link on how to get the chat ID of a group chat:

You need to set the bot's public url and the bot token in the bot.py

You also need to edit credentials.json to your own Google Sheets API
see below link for more information on how to get your own API keys for Google Sheet:
https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/python


Install the required libraries using:
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt

In rare cases where you see errors on this, Instead of that use :
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt




FINALLY - Run the bot using :

sudo python3 bot.py

If the command did not work, use :
sudo python bot.py


The bot HAS to be admin in both groups to work out..
